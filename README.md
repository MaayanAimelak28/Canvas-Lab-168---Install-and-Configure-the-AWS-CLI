Install and Configure the AWS CLI

Lab overview

The AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) is a command line tool that provides an interface for interacting with products and services from Amazon Web Services (AWS).

You can install the AWS CLI on your local machine or a virtual machine such as an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance.

In this activity, you install and configure the AWS CLI on a Red Hat Linux instance because this instance type does not have the AWS CLI pre-installed. Some instance types, such as Amazon Linux, do come pre-installed with the AWS CLI.

During this activity, you establish a Secure Shell (SSH) connection to the instance. You configure the installation with an access key that can connect to an AWS account. Finally, you practice using the AWS CLI to interact with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM).

When you finish the activity, it will reflect the following diagram:
